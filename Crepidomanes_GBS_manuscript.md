ABSTRACT
========

INTRODUCTION
============
  * Why independent gametophytes are interesting
  * Why Crepidomanes is a good example to use
  * Little is known about Crepidomanes population genetics
  * There are other filmy species in North America and filmies have been shown to form multi-species, interbreeding communities.
  * Goals of project:
    * Explore population structure of Crepidomanes independent gametophytes at different scales
    * Test hypotheses about how these populations were established and spread
    * First needed to separate non-Crepidomanes samples

This is an example citation [@Altschul1990-ri; @Andrews2010-ov].

METHODS
=======
  * Sample collection and selection
  * DNA extraction, GBS library prep, and sequencing
  * Data QC
  * ipyrad analysis (read clustering, SNP detection and filtering)
  * BLAST to look for contaminants here? At this point I still have the locus consensus sequences but I also have many loci. Later when I've filtered to a more manageable number of loci I can't get to the consensus sequences as easily.
  * All-sample analysis to identify species
    * PCR species tests
    * structure
    * Distance trees
  * Process to remove non-Crepidomanes signal from the dataset
  * Crepidomanes-only analysis
    * Comparison of locus subgroups (Hobs0, Hmax, and 3-genotype loci) and argument for removing Hmax loci
      * BLAST to look for contaminants here? I'd have to be able to trace SNPs back to locus consensus sequences.
    * structure
    * Distance trees
    * allele frequency (PoolSeq-like using Poptree?) analysis
    * Isolation by Distance
      * Over the entire geographic range
      * At smaller geographic scales (just within Southern Illinois?)
      * What is the average genetic distance of samples within a single sample? From a single site? Within a single region? How does that compare to the landscape average?


Secondary heading
-----------------

Hashtag-style headings work too if you need further levels. Some text.

RESULTS
=======
 * A better plot to show the process for deciding on a clustering level would be to plot cluster level on the x and number of clusters on the Y with a set of points for the average of the Vbos sporophytes and set of points for an equal number of Vbos gametophytes with similar numbers of reads.
