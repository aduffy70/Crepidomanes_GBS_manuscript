              asexual reproduction are recognized: (1) the asexual reproduction
              s. str. by regeneration from$\pm$specialized caducous organs
              (leaves, leaf apices, shoots, branches, bulbils) and by
              production of specialized propagules (gemmae, protonemal brood
              cells, tubers), (2) fragmentation of plants, resp. part of plants
              into$\pm$unspecialized fragments, and (3) clonal reproduction
              (cloning). The latter occurs in bryophytes by protonema decay, by
              disintegration of modules, resp. formation of ramets (dividuals,
              ``daughter plants'') that leads to self-cloning or forced-cloning
              of parts of the gametophyte (shoots, stoloniferous and
              rhizomatous axes, rhizoid wicks, basiscopic innovation plants).
              Clonal reproduction (cloning), in former time scarcely noted,
              gained great interest within the last decade mainly in vascular
              plants showing clonal growth. This reproduction mechanism is
              thought to be a keystone factor for asexual reproduction, habitat
              colonization and habitat maintenance. Species which reproduce
              clonally are able to colonize and maintain habitats in an

              are dispersed, thus allowing population establishment and
              maintenance. However, it is unknown if or how protonemata-one of
              their asexually produced propagules-are dispersed. Moss
              protonemata were exposed to three dispersal vectors (water, wind,
              and snails) to describe the dispersal capability and survival
              after dispersal. METHODS: The protonemata of mosses Callicostella
              belangeriana and Taxiphyllum taxirameum were splashed with water
              drops from a 1 or 2 m height, exposed to two wind velocities (V1
              = 2.74 mps and V2 = 3.76 mps), and fed to terrestrial snails.
              Dispersal of protonemata was described for wind and water by
              studying the dispersal distance and the relationships between
              protonemata sizes and dispersal distances. Survival after
              dispersal was recorded for the three vectors. KEY RESULTS: Water
              and wind dispersed protonemata up to 80 and 265.5 cm,
              respectively. The protonemata dispersed the farthest distance
              when splashed by 2 m drops and hit by V2 wind velocities. No, or
              little, relationship between protonemata size and dispersal
              distance was found for the water and wind vectors. Protonemata
              survived and became established after dispersal: survival was
              high when dispersed by water and snails, but was low for wind.
              CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, it was shown that protonemata
              are dispersed mostly close to the source, which is suggested to

  abstract = "Premise of research. Ferns (monilophytes) and lycophytes are
              unique among land plants in having two independent life stages:
              the gametophyte generation, which is generally small, cordiform,
              and short-lived, senescing after fertilization, and the
              sporophyte generation, which is considered the dominant,
              long-lived portion of the life cycle produced following
              fertilization. In many species of epiphytic ferns, however, the
              gametophyte generation is capable of sustained vegetative growth,
              and some are able to reproduce asexually via gemmae. These two
              characteristics have increased the independence of these
              gametophytes, so much so that some species never produce
              sporophytes at all, while other species produce sporophytes only
              in parts of their geographic range, a trend we term here the
              ``separation of generations.''Pivotal results. Long-lived fern
              gametophytes have evolved independently in several families and
              can be found around the world. We present a comprehensive review
              of the long-lived fern gametophytes that are able to forgo the
              production of a sporophyte, including accounts of their
              discovery, taxonomy, biology, ecology, and biogeography. We also
              present several hypotheses concerning why these species do not
              produce sporophytes, identify gaps in our knowledge about these
              organisms, and suggest areas of future study.Conclusions. While
              several populations of independent gametophytes have been
              identified and characterized in temperate regions, it is likely
              that the bulk of species with spatially separated generations
              occur in the tropics, where little work has been done.
              Additionally, virtually no studies have been undertaken that
              attempt to determine the underlying factors inhibiting sporophyte
              production in ferns. As 2017 marks the fiftieth anniversary of
              the first comprehensive study published on independent fern
              gametophytes, we can think of no better time for a review on

              Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to

  abstract = "Pine cones that remain closed and retain seeds until fire causes
              the cones to open (cone serotiny) represent a key adaptive trait
              in a variety of pine species. In lodgepole pine, there is
              substantial geographical variation in serotiny across the Rocky
              Mountain region. This variation in serotiny has evolved as a
              result of geographically divergent selection, with consequences
              that extend to forest communities and ecosystems. An
              understanding of the genetic architecture of this trait is of
              interest owing to the wide-reaching ecological consequences of
              serotiny and also because of the repeated evolution of the trait
              across the genus. Here, we present and utilize an inexpensive and
              time-effective method for generating population genomic data. The
              method uses restriction enzymes and PCR amplification to generate
              a library of fragments that can be sequenced with a high level of
              multiplexing. We obtained data for more than 95,000 single
              nucleotide polymorphisms across 98 serotinous and nonserotinous
              lodgepole pines from three populations. We used a Bayesian
              generalized linear model (GLM) to test for an association between
              genotypic variation at these loci and serotiny. The probability
              of serotiny varied by genotype at 11 loci, and the association
              between genotype and serotiny at these loci was consistent in
              each of the three populations of pines. Genetic variation across
              these 11 loci explained 50\% of the phenotypic variation in
              serotiny. Our results provide a first genome-wide association map

              documented an association between ecological divergence and

              of natural selection in genome divergence during the process of

              models to test the hypothesis that loci under divergent selection
              between two butterfly species (Lycaeides idas and L. melissa)

              measures of genetic differentiation between L. idas and L.
              melissa and genomic introgression in hybrids varied across the
              genome. The most differentiated genetic regions were
              characterized by elevated L. idas ancestry in the admixed
              population, which occurs in L. idas-like habitat, consistent with
              the hypothesis that local adaptation contributes to speciation.
              Moreover, locus-specific measures of genetic differentiation (a
              metric of divergent selection) were positively associated with
              extreme genomic introgression (a metric of hybrid fitness).
              Interestingly, concordance of differentiation and introgression

              ferns. This has led to the widespread belief that ferns, once a

              ecological predominance of angiosperms and are mostly
              evolutionary holdovers from the late Palaeozoic/early Mesozoic

              speciosum is unique amongst European pteridophytes in that both
              phases of the life cycle are perennial and capable of vegetative
              propagation. Within sites no variation was revealed by allozyme

              Two of these MLPs covered large areas while the others were
              restricted to one, or few localities. Asexual reproduction of the
              gametophyte via gemmae is assumed to be the main means of

              sporophyte production, but rather the prevailing climatic
              conditions. The sporophyte is extremely rare and vulnerable.

              (sporophyte and gametophyte generations present) and asexual
              (gametophyte only) ranges. It was first discovered in central
              Europe in 1993 and is represented in this area only by its
              perennial, vegetatively propagating gametophyte generation.
              Genetic variation has been investigated at 35 sites. Allozyme
              diversity is partitioned primarily between, not within, sites.
              Although genetic variation exists at a fine scale (lt 5 m) within
              some populations, the results suggest that clones were not
              intimately associated in these cases. The majority of sites
              support unique multilocus phenotypes. Where phenotypes were
              present at more than one site they tended to recur at the next
              closest site. However, similar phenotypes link eastern and
              western Pf{\"a}lzerwald sites up to c. 70 km apart. This pattern
              of diversity suggests that colonisation was not solely of a

              climatically favourable period, probably the Atlantic
              hypsithermal, there may have been an explosive colonisation by
              long?distance dispersal from refugial areas. This was followed by
              a short period during which sporophyte production, sexual
              reproduction and local spread were possible. With climatic
              change, reduction in the available habitat and the loss of the
              sporophyte generation, different individual genets became fixed
              within small, favourable, but scattered, sites. The possibility
              that some central European sites north of the Alps acted as
              periglacial refugia cannot be discounted, but would appear less
              likely than (re?) colonisation from the Atlantic fringe.",

              sporophyte (fern plant) generation are described. Two-way
              indicator species analysis suggests that T. speciosum occurs in
              four main floristic groups; in very deeply shaded habitats; in
              large dripping caves; in crevices in cliffs and small caves; and
              on dripping vertical cliffs and rocky banks in wooded ravines.
              Canonical correspondence analysis shows that altitude and habitat
              types are the major environmental variables influencing the
              floristic composition of the 43 colonies. Monitoring data suggest
              that frond number remains remarkably constant over 13--29 years.
              Possible reasons for the absence of T. speciosum in so many
              apparently suitable habitats in western Britain and Ireland are
              discussed. Sporophyte establishment appears to be most critical,
              especially under a climate that is marginal for its temperature
              requirements. The distribution pattern of T. speciosum and its
              ability to colonise man-made habitats in northern France but not
              in Britain or Ireland suggest that some factor associated with
              temperature may be limiting. As each colony may consist of one or
              two individual plants with many fronds arising from the rhizome
              mass, there are only about 50--100 plants of the sporophyte
              generation known in Britain and Ireland. There is thus a need to
              protect all remaining colonies in the British Isles from
              interference, especially collecting and habitat alteration.
              Extreme discretion with information about localities is

              land plants with two free-living generations (sporophytes and
              gametophytes); hence, a single species may have two different
              distributions. The distribution of the gametophytes of most fern
              species, which are much smaller in size than sporophytes, are
              almost unknown due to the difficulty of identifying gametophytes
              using morphological characters. METHODS: Twelve quadrats (1 m(2)
              or 0.25 m(2)), each subdivided into a grid of 100 (10 $\times$
              10) or 25 (5 $\times$ 5) squares, were used to survey
              gametophytes in the Japanese Archipelago, where distribution data
              of sporophytes and ``DNA barcodes'' for identification of
              gametophytes have fully been established in previous studies.
              Collected gametophytes were identified using the plastid rbcL-a
              region. KEY RESULTS: In total, gametophytes of 38 species in two
              broad morphological categories (28 cordiform and 10 noncordiform
              species) were identified among 407 collections. The cordiform
              gametophytes discovered are without exception accompanied by
              their conspecific sporophytes at the periphery of the quadrats.
              On the other hand, the sporophytic counterparts of the
              noncordiform gametophytes are often not found or are rare around
              the sites. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates with a regional
              flora that fern gametophytes do not always co-occur with
              sporophytes of the same species. In particular, noncordiform
              gametophytes tended to occur independently of conspecific
              sporophytes. This pattern may be due to the capability for
              indeterminate growth and vegetative reproduction by gemmae in

               Grammitidaceae, and Vittariaceae produce dispersible gemmae.
               Each of these characteristics increases opportunity for
               outbreeding, and when island floras are statistically compared
               with floras of adjacent mainlands, island floras are found to be
               rich in epiphytic species possessing gemmae (Hymenophyllaceae,
               Grammitidaceae, and Vittariaceae), and depauperate in epiphytic
               species lacking gemmae (Polypodiaceae and Elaphoglossaceae). We
               propose that gametophytic gemmae significantly aid long-distance
               colonization of outbreeding species because gemmae 1) allow
               gametophytes to exploit available niches through dispersal of
               gemmae, and through clonal expansion and persistence of the
               resulting gametophyte, and 2) facilitate sexual reproduction by
               providing the opportunity for sperm and antheridiogen transfer
               when gametophytes are distant, and by providing a new source of
               tissue for antheridia formation.",

  abstract = "Gametophytes of Callistopteris baueriana (Endl.) Copeland exhibit
              an unreported and unique morphology for the Hymenophyllaceae,
              combining characters that traditionally have been thought to be
              specific to either Hymenophyllum s. 1. or Trichomanes s. 1. We
              describe here the mature gametophyte morphology of C. baueriana
              from Hawaii. To explore gametophyte character evolution in the
              Hymenophyllaceae, gametophyte characters of selected genera
              within the family were analyzed phylogenetically. In Hawaii,
              gametophytes of C. baueriana were associated with sporophyte
              production or grew independently, often in extensive, dense mats.
              Well-developed sporophytes occurred at high elevations. At drier
              midelevations, sporophytes were dwarfed. Sporophytes were absent
              at the lowest elevations and gametophytes grew independently in
              large bryophyte-like mats. The sporophytes of C. baueriana seemed
              unable to survive and reproduce in dry conditions, whereas
              gametophytes survived and maintained their presence by vegetative
              growth and the production of gemmae. The gametophytes had a
              branched, ribbon-like thallus and were long-lived and
              clone-forming. Generally, a meristematic branch grew along the
              substrate while subordinate branches grew perpendicularly to the
              substrate and terminated in the production of gemmae. The gemmae
              were largely uniseriate, spindle-shaped, and branched or
              unbranched. Each sat between apical protuberances of a bulbous
              gemmifer. At maturity the gemma abscised from the gemmifer,
              possibly with the assistance of pressure from the apical
              protuberances and swollen dorsal side of the gemmifer.
              Antheridia, produced marginally on small thalli or on gemmae,
              were composed of at least five cells, and averaged 76 $\mu$m in
              diameter. Archegonia were formed ventrally on lateral pads and
              had necks composed of four tiers of cells. Parsimony analysis of
              gametophyte characters of selected genera within the
              Hymenophyllaceae resulted in a single, most parsimonious tree,
              with Callistopteris sister to Trichomanes s. s. and
              Vandenboschia, the two most derived taxa in the analysis.
              Mecodium was sister to the clade containing Callistopteris,
              Trichomanes s. s. and Vandenboschia. Hymenophyllum s. s. was the
              basal-most taxon. The tree was consistent with hypotheses of
              gametophyte character evolution within the Hymenophyllaceae,
              proposing that gametophyte growth habit composed partly or wholly
              of filaments, one-dimensional gemmae, elongate, flask-shaped
              gemmifers, archegonia with necks of four tiers of cells, and
              small antheridia of five jacket cells are derived characters
              within the family. A thalloid growth habit, two-dimensional
              gemmae, bulbous gemmifers, archegonial necks with six to 10 tiers
              of cells, and large complex antheridia represent ancestral

              of ferns native to northern Japan",
  author   = "Sato, Toshiyuki",
  abstract = "To investigate life history adaptations to cold climates, the
              leaf development, sporulation period, growing stage of
              gametophytes, and the frost and drought resistance of sporophytes
              and gametophytes of 67 fern species native to Kokkaido were
              studied. Most ferns common in Hokkaido are summer-green with
              leaves developing during late May to June and decaying during
              October. Most of the ferns in Hokkaido sporulate during August to
              early September. Spores dispersed from June to September
              germinate before winter begins, forming vegetative prothallia.
              Gametophytes mature only in the following summer. Thus in
              Hokkaido the gametophytes as well as perennial sporophytes are
              exposed to severe winter conditions. In order to correlate the
              life cycles of temperate ferns with winter cold stress, frost
              resistance of gametophytes, rhizomes, and leaves of sporophytes
              were determined. Maximal frost resistance of rhizomes reflects
              the stress conditions of their habitats: rhizomes of forest
              understory ferns are damaged at-5°to -17.5°C, epiphytic ferns and
              ferns of habitats exposed to severe frost sustained temperatures
              of -20° to-40°C. The leaves of winter-green and evergreen ferns
              resist frost ranging from -25° to -40°C. The leaves of
              summer-green ferns are killed by late frost below -5°C. With some
              exceptions, gametophytes of ferns growing on the forest floor
              resist frost to -40°C and are much hardier than sporophytes.
              These results suggest the possible restrictive effects of cold
              climate on the life span of leaves as well as on the sporulation
              period. If winter cold is one of the decisive factors for
              seasonality expression and habitat distribution of ferns, the
              sensitive generation must be the sporophyte rather than the
              gametophyte. The hardier gametophyte is therefore able to
              colonize habitats in which the sporophyte is excluded by frost if
              mechanisms of vegetative propagation are evolved.",

              Pool-seq is an alternative cost- and time-effective option in

              However, pooling of DNA creates new problems and challenges for
              accurate variant call and allele frequency (AF) estimation. In
              particular, sequencing errors confound with the alleles present

              importance to molecular ecology. Restriction site-associated DNA
              sequencing (RADseq), a popular reduced representation method, has
              ushered in a new era of genome-scale research for assessing
              population structure, hybridization, demographic history,
              phylogeography and migration. RADseq has also been widely used to
              conduct genome scans to detect loci involved in adaptive
              divergence among natural populations. Here, we examine the
              capacity of those RADseq-based genome scan studies to detect loci
              involved in local adaptation. To understand what proportion of
              the genome is missed by RADseq studies, we developed a simple
              model using different numbers of RAD-tags, genome sizes and
              extents of linkage disequilibrium (length of haplotype blocks).
              Under the best-case modelling scenario, we found that RADseq
              using six- or eight-base pair cutting restriction enzymes would
              fail to sample many regions of the genome, especially for species
              with short linkage disequilibrium. We then surveyed recent
              studies that have used RADseq for genome scans and found that the
              median density of markers across these studies was 4.08 RAD-tag
              markers per megabase (one marker per 245 kb). The length of
              linkage disequilibrium for many species is one to three orders of
              magnitude less than density of the typical recent RADseq study.
              Thus, we conclude that genome scans based on RADseq data alone,
              while useful for studies of neutral genetic variation and genetic
              population structure, will likely miss many loci under selection

  abstract = "PREMISE OF THE STUDY: For many plant species, historical climatic
              conditions may have left lasting imprints that are detectable in
              contemporary populations. Additionally, if these historical
              conditions also prevented gene flow among populations, these
              populations may be differentiated with respect to one another and
              their contemporary environmental conditions. For the fern,
              Vittaria appalachiana, one theory is that historical conditions
              during the Pleistocene largely shaped both the distribution and
              lack of sporophyte production. Our goals-based on this
              theory-were to examine physiological differences among and within
              populations spanning the species' geographic range, and the
              contribution of historical climatic conditions to this
              differentiation. METHODS: We exposed explants from five
              populations to four drying treatments and examined differences in
              physiological response. Additionally, we examined the role of
              historical and current climatic conditions in driving the
              observed population differentiation. KEY RESULTS: Populations
              differ in their ability to tolerate varying levels of
              dehydration, displaying a pattern of countergradient selection.
              Exposure to historical and contemporary climatic conditions,
              specifically variation in temperature and precipitation regimes,
              resulted in population divergence observed among contemporary
              populations. CONCLUSIONS: Historical conditions have shaped not
              only the distribution of V. appalachiana, but also its current
              physiological limitations. Results from this study support the
              hypothesis that climatic conditions during the Pleistocene are
              responsible for the distribution of this species, and may be
              responsible for the observed differences in dehydration
              tolerance. Additionally, dehydration tolerance may be the driving
              factor for previously reported patterns of countergradient
              selection in this species.",

              nutritionally independent sporophyte (diploid) and gametophyte

              life cycle for fern community ecology have rarely been
              considered. To compare patterns of community structure between
              fern sporophytes and gametophytes, we conducted a survey of the
              ferns of the islands of Moorea and Tahiti (French Polynesia). We
              first constructed a DNA barcode library (plastid rbcL and
              trnH-psbA) for the two island floras including 145 fern species.
              We then used these DNA barcodes to identify more than 1300
              field-collected gametophytes from 25 plots spanning an
              elevational gradient from 200 to 2000 m. We found that species
              richness of fern sporophytes conforms to the well-known unimodal
              (i.e., mid-elevation peak) pattern, reaching a maximum at
              ~1000--1200 m. Moreover, we found that fern sporophyte
              communities become increasingly phylogenetically clustered at
              high elevations. In contrast, species richness of fern
              gametophytes was consistent across sites, and gametophytes showed
              no correlation of phylogenetic community structure with
              elevation. Turnover of sporophyte and gametophyte communities was
              closely linked with elevation at shallow phylogenetic levels, but
              not at deeper nodes in the tree. Finally, we found several
              species for which gametophytes had broader ranges than
              sporophytes, including a vittarioid fern with abundant
              gametophytes but extremely rare sporophytes. Our study highlights
              the importance of including diverse life history stages in
              surveys of community structure, and has implications for the

              of the ploidy stages in colonizing populations. We tested for
              shifts in ploidy and reproductive mode across native and
              introduced populations of the red seaweed Gracilaria
              vermiculophylla. Native populations in the northwest Pacific
              Ocean were nearly always attached by holdfasts to hard substrata
              and, as is characteristic of the genus, haploid-diploid ratios
              were slightly diploid-biased. In contrast, along North American
              and European coastlines, introduced populations nearly always
              floated atop soft-sediment mudflats and were overwhelmingly
              dominated by diploid thalli without holdfasts. Introduced
              populations exhibited population genetic signals consistent with
              extensive vegetative fragmentation, while native populations did
              not. Thus, the ecological shift from attached to unattached
              thalli, ostensibly necessitated by the invasion of soft-sediment
              habitats, correlated with shifts from sexual to asexual
              reproduction and slight to strong diploid bias. We extend Baker's
              Law by predicting other colonizing haplo-diplontic species will
              show similar increases in asexuality that correlate with the
              dominance of one ploidy stage. Labile mating systems likely
              facilitate colonization success and subsequent range expansion,
              but for haplo-diplontic species, the long-term eco-evolutionary
              impacts will depend on which ploidy stage is lost and the degree
              to which asexual reproduction is canalized.",

  abstract = "PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Hybridization is an important mechanism of
              speciation in plants and often results in complexes that comprise
              multiple sexual diploids and their hybrid offspring. However, the
              intricacy of these systems has prevented a thorough understanding
              of many groups. The Crepidomanes minutum species complex
              (Hymenophyllaceae) is a widely distributed, morphologically
              variable fern species complex. Although prior reports of apogamy
              and polyploidy suggest hybridization, it has never been the focus
              of a phylogenetic study. METHODS: Morphology, nuclear (gapCp),
              and chloroplast (rbcL) DNA sequences, cytology, field
              observation, and spore counts were used to infer phylogeny and
              trace hybrid origins. KEY RESULTS: The C. minutum species complex
              is composed of at least three major clades: the African clade,
              clade 1 (East Asia and the Pacific), and clade 2 (Southeast Asia
              and the South Pacific). Clades 1 and 2 differ strikingly in
              morphological variation (uniform in clade 1 vs. highly variable
              in clade 2) and occurrence of hybrids (rare in clade 1 vs.
              frequent in clade 2). Apogamy and polyploidy were confirmed as
              likely mechanisms of hybrid stabilization in clade 2. Despite the
              large genetic distance between clades 1 and 2, several specimens
              were observed with gapCp sequences from both; diploid genome size

              multiple diploid lineages and their stabilized hybrid crosses.

              limited dispersal potential. Here, we evaluated the role of
              temperature in driving population differentiation in an asexual,
              obligate gametophyte fern species. METHODS: We reciprocally
              transplanted Vittaria appalachiana gametophytes among six
              populations that spanned the species' geographic range in the
              Appalachian Mountains and Plateau. Temperature, survival, and
              senescence rates were measured for 1 year. KEY RESULTS:
              Populations had significantly different fitness responses to
              different sites, consistent with the hypothesis that populations
              have differentiated across the species' range. There was some
              evidence for local adaptation in marginal populations and for
              countergradient selection favoring particularly robust genotypes
              at the northern range edge. Most populations had relatively high
              fitness at the site with the most stable temperature conditions
              and were negatively affected by decreasing minimum temperatures.
              CONCLUSIONS: Populations of Vittaria appalachiana exhibit highly
              variable responses to transplantation across the species' range,
              and only a small subset of these responses are due to local
              adaptation. Differences in daily minimum temperature explain some
              variation in fitness, but other site-specific factors also have
              significant impacts on transplant fitness. These results indicate
              that asexual, patchily distributed species with limited dispersal
              may exhibit population-specific responses to global climate

              phase and a (usually) short-lived gametophyte phase. Notably,
              however, some species have perennial, vegetatively reproducing
              gametophytes. Vittaria appalachiana is one of just three species
              in which mature sporophytes are unknown. It has a wide range
              throughout the Appalachian Mountains and Plateau, where it
              reproduces asexually via gemmae. The origin of V. appalachiana,
              however, has long been a mystery, with most previous studies
              suggesting it may have resulted from hybridization of two closely
              related Vittaria species (V. graminifolia and V. lineata).
              METHODS: A four-gene plastid data set including 32 samples of six
              Vittaria species, plus samples of five outgroup species, was
              analyzed to uncover phylogenetic relationships. Additional
              analyses of nuclear DET1 gene sequences allowed for the
              examination of hypotheses involving a hybrid origin for V.
              appalachiana. KEY RESULTS: In the plastid phylogeny, V.
              appalachiana is well supported as monophyletic, but is embedded
              within V. graminifolia. With the exception of a single aberrant
              allele, this result is mirrored in the nuclear tree. CONCLUSIONS:
              Through analyses of plastid and nuclear data sets, this study
              demonstrates that a hybrid origin for V. appalachiana is
              unlikely. Instead, it appears that this species emerged from
              within the V. graminifolia lineage. Further work is needed to
              fully elucidate the genetic structure within this group.",

              both analytical and stochastic simulation approaches. High rates
              of clonal reproduction will positively affect heterozygosity. As
              a consequence, nearly twice as many alleles per locus can be
              maintained and population differentiation estimated as F(ST)
              value is strongly decreased in purely clonal populations as
              compared to purely sexual ones. With increasing clonal
              reproduction, effective population size first slowly increases
              and then points toward extreme values when the reproductive
              system tends toward strict clonality. This reflects the fact that
              polymorphism is protected within individuals due to fixed
              heterozygosity. Contrarily, genotypic diversity smoothly
              decreases with increasing rates of clonal reproduction. Asexual
              populations thus maintain higher genetic diversity at each single

  abstract = "Aim A species' distribution reflects its ecological niche when
              all of the habitats that support population growth are occupied.
              However, organisms with limited dispersal potential may not
              colonize all suitable habitats and may consist of differentially
              adapted populations that have different niche requirements. Here,
              we evaluate the factors determining the northern range limit in a
              fern species that is endemic to a patchily distributed habitat
              throughout its geographic range. Location Non-calcareous rock
              shelters that provide habitat for six separate populations
              spanning the geographic range of Vittaria appalachiana, an
              asexual, gametophytic fern species, in the Appalachian Mountains
              and Appalachian Plateau of eastern North America. Methods We
              transplanted V. appalachiana gametophytes from six different
              populations to a rock shelter habitat 19 km north of the
              contemporary northern range boundary and 48 km away from the most
              northern population and back into their home locations as
              experimental controls. We compared the fitness of transplants at
              `home' versus `beyond the northern range limit' to test whether
              the northern range boundary is defined by physiological limits or
              dispersal limitation. Furthermore, we tested whether transplant
              success beyond the northern range boundary varied among
              individuals collected from different populations in the species'
              range. Results Overall, transplant performance was similar
              between the home locations and the site beyond the northern range
              limit. However, populations differed in their response to
              transplantation beyond the northern range boundary, with
              individuals from the northernmost population having higher
              fitness beyond the range limit than all other populations. Main
              Conclusions We conclude that the northern range limit of V.
              appalachiana is heavily influenced by dispersal limitation
              because transplant performance was, on average, similar between
              home sites and beyond the northern range limit. However, because
              populations varied in their relative performance beyond the range
              limit, we also conclude that the ecological niches of these
              populations are not equivalent.",

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Restriction-site-associated genomic markers are a
              powerful tool for investigating evolutionary questions at the
              population level, but are limited in their utility at deeper
              phylogenetic scales where fewer orthologous loci are typically
              recovered across disparate taxa. While this limitation stems in
              part from mutations to restriction recognition sites that disrupt
              data generation, an additional source of data loss comes from the
              failure to identify homology during bioinformatic analyses.
              Clustering methods that allow for lower similarity thresholds and
              the inclusion of indel variation will perform better at
              assembling RADseq loci at the phylogenetic scale. RESULTS: PyRAD
              is a pipeline to assemble de novo RADseq loci with the aim of
              optimizing coverage across phylogenetic datasets. It uses a
              wrapper around an alignment-clustering algorithm, which allows
              for indel variation within and between samples, as well as for
              incomplete overlap among reads (e.g. paired-end). Here I compare
              PyRAD with the program Stacks in their performance analyzing a
              simulated RADseq dataset that includes indel variation. Indels
              disrupt clustering of homologous loci in Stacks but not in PyRAD,
              such that the latter recovers more shared loci across disparate
              taxa. I show through reanalysis of an empirical RADseq dataset
              that indels are a common feature of such data, even at shallow
              phylogenetic scales. PyRAD uses parallel processing as well as an
              optional hierarchical clustering method, which allows it to
              rapidly assemble phylogenetic datasets with hundreds of sampled
              individuals. AVAILABILITY: Software is written in Python and

              selection. To date, high capacity, low cost genotyping has been
              largely achieved via ``SNP chip'' microarray-based platforms
              which require substantial prior knowledge of both genome sequence
              and variability, and once designed are suitable only for those

              substantial ascertainment bias and inherently precludes detection

              information for both population history and genotype-phenotype

              sequencing experiments on massively parallel sequencers (commonly

              to the problem of population genotyping, but increased cost and

              widespread adoption. Here, we describe a complete laboratory
