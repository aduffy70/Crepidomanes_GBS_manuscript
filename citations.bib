  abstract    = "A new approach to rapid sequence comparison, basic local
                 alignment search tool (BLAST), directly approximates
                 alignments that optimize a measure of local similarity, the
                 maximal segment pair (MSP) score. Recent mathematical results
                 on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis
                 of the performance of this method as well as the statistical
                 significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm
                 is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of
                 ways and applied in a variety of contexts including
                 straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches,
                 motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the
                 analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA
                 sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to
                 mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster
                 than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable
                 sensitivity.",
