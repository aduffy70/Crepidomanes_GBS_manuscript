__Figure XX__ - Locations and species assigned based on this study of _Crepidomanes intricatum_, _Didymoglossum petersii_, _Vandenboschia boschiana_, and potentially mixed samples.

__Figure XX - Probabilites of assignment to the cluster without gametophytes in Structure runs using the All-33, All-50, and All-66 datasets. "Suspected spp" is the species the collector of the samples assumed based on geographic location and presence/absence of nearby sporophytes. "Assigned spp" is the species assignment for this study based on the Structure results. Error bars show the combined confidence intervals from all three runs.
