__Figure XX__ - Probabilites of assignment to the cluster without gametophytes in Structure runs using the All-33, All-50, and All-66 datasets. "Suspected spp" is the species the collector of the samples assumed based on geographic location and presence/absence of nearby sporophytes. "Assigned spp" is the species assignment for this study based on the Structure results. Error bars show the combined confidence intervals from all three runs.

__Figure XX__ - Results of Structure analyses for the datasets including samples assigned as _C. intricatum_ or mixed/unknown, with and without non-_Crepidomanes_ loci. Results shown are from the best of 10 runs using the optimal number of clusters for each dataset.

__Figure XX__ - Results of Structure analyses for the datasets including only samples assigned as _C. intricatum_, with and without non-_Crepidomanes_ loci. Results shown are from the best of 10 runs using the optimal number of clusters for each dataset.

__Figure XX__ - K-means analysis of subset of the data with only _C. intricatum_ samples and with non-_Crepidomanes_ loci removed. 20 replicate Structure runs with number of clusters (K) ranging from 1 to 15.
