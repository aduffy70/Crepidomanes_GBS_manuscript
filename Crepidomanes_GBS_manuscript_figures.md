__Figure 5__ - Probabilites of assignment to the cluster without gametophytes in Structure runs using the All-33, All-50, and All-66 datasets. "Suspected spp" is the species the collector of the samples assumed based on geographic location and presence/absence of nearby sporophytes. "Assigned spp" is the species assignment for this study based on the Structure results. Error bars show the combined confidence intervals for all three datasets.
