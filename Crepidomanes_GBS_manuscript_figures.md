__Figure 5__ - Probabilites of assignment to the cluster without gametophytes in Structure runs using the All-33, All-50, and All-66 datasets. "Suspected spp" is the species the collector of the samples assumed based on geographic location and presence/absence of nearby sporophytes. "Assigned spp" is the species assignment for this study based on the Structure results. Error bars show the combined confidence intervals for all three datasets.

__Figure 14__ - Pairwise comparisons of genetic distance vs. geographic distance in _C. intricatum_ samples.

__Figure 15__ - Genetic distance between _C. intricatum_ samples at different geographic scales. Within collection = growing within approximately 10 cm of each other. Within site = different collections within approximately 100 meters. Within region = different sites within 100 km. Between regions = over 100 km apart.

__Figure 16__ - Comparisons of distribution of pairwise distances of within-collection samples and non-within-collection samples in a) the original GBS dataset and b) a GBS dataset generated by replacing within-collection samples with resampled simulated clones. The density curve describes the distribution of pairwise distances of the non-within-collection samples and the vertical lines indicate the pairwise distances of within-collection samples or simulated clones. Red=S05--S06, Green=S09--S10, Blue=S16--S17, Cyan=S38--S39, Magenta=S43--S44--S46--S47--S48.
