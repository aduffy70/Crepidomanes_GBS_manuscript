__Figure 4__ - Mean clusters per sample for _Vandenboschiana boschiana_ sporophytes and gametophytes at a range of cluster threshold values.

__Figure 5__ - Probabilites of assignment to the cluster without sporophytes in Structure runs using the All-33, All-50, and All-66 datasets. "Suspected spp" is the species assumed by the collector of the sample based on geographic location and observed presence/absence of sporophytes. "Assigned spp" is the species assignment for this study based on the Structure results. Error bars show the combined extents of the confidence intervals for all three datasets.

__Figure 12__ - Genetic distance between _C. intricatum_ samples at different geographic scales. Within collection = growing within approximately 10 cm of each other. Within site = different collections within approximately 100 meters. Within region = different sites within 100 km. Between regions = over 100 km apart.

__Figure 14__ - Minimum spanning network for _C. intricatum_ samples. Nodes are colored based on geographic region and node positions are suggestive of the relative positions of collection sites within each region. Thicker/darker lines represent smaller pairwise genetic distances.

__Figure 15__ - Distribution of pairwise distances of within-collection samples and non-within-collection samples in a) the original GBS dataset and b) a GBS dataset generated after replacing within-collection samples with resampled, simulated clones. The density curve describes the distribution of pairwise distances of all 25 samples and the vertical lines indicate the pairwise distances of within-collection samples or simulated clones. Red=S05--S06, green=S09--S10, blue=S16--S17, cyan=S38--S39, orange=S43--S44--S46--S47--S48.

__Figure 16__ - Distribution of pairwise genetic distances for 25 _C. intricatum_ samples. Three overlapping histograms represent pairwise comparisons between any two of the eight most genetically similar samples (blue), comparisons between the four most genetically distant samples and all other samples (red), and all other pairwise comparisons (black).
